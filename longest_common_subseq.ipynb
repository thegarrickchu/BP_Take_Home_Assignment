    "Notes: To solve and also generalize to many cases, will utilize a dynamic programming method. \n",
    "Generally, there are 2 cases: either the last characters of each string match or they don't.  This assumption will act as the basis for building the function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach will be to generate a 2-day array (table) that evaluates each strings element and then returns value that is either 0 (starting point), increments the length by 1 (if there is a match), or if there is no match takes the max of the adjacent elements' values. In other words: Upon each instance, we will evaluate whether the element matches and increment the running count of len(lcs[i][j]) by 1. If no match, len(lcs[i][j]) = max(LCS[i-1][j], LCS[i][j-1]). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: takes in 2 strings and compares such that the function outputs both the character elements and the length of the character elements from the longest common subsequence.  Aka output = arr(longest common subsequence) and the value count of the longest common subsequence. \n",
